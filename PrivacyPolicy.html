    <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
    <hr />
    <div class="content">
      <h2>General</h2>
      <p>
        This document elucidates on the data collected by the developer, Kaizad
        Wadia (henceforth referred to as "me" or "I") of the Alexa Skill "Gym
        Progress Tracker" (henceforth referred to as "the skill") from the user
        thereof and the protection of the user's privacy. However, prior to
        reading this document, it would be worthwhile to first look at that of
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GX7NJQ4ZB8MHFRNJ"
          target="_blank"
        >
          Amazon Digital Services LLC
        </a>
        (with its affiliates, “Amazon”). This furthermore pertains to the use of
        the Alexa Voice Service provided by Amazon for which there exist
        "skills" that are created independently by developers. The document aims
        to elaborate on the privacy and use of the user's personal data for the
        skill that I have created. By utilizing "Gym Progress Tracker" you, the
        user, agree to this policy in its entirety.
      </p>
      <h2>Data Collection</h2>
      <p>
        For the purpose of full disclosure, the phone number of each user is
        used, but not stored. This is for its most prominent feature, which
        sends an SMS text message to the user. As a working phone number is
        mandatory in order to have a text message delivered and received, I
        request for the current phone number of the user. I also query for the
        time zone of the user for scheduling purposes. This keeps the day
        consistent with what the user expects. However, it is not stored. Since
        the skill requires uniquely identifiable information in order to
        retreive the data for the particular user, the Amazon User
        Identification parameter is used for storing persistent data in between
        sessions. Users may speak to the skill and have their queries and / or
        statements recorded, specifically the weights of their exercises. As
        this involves the core functionality of the skill and is the primary
        purpose, this data is collected and stored on the Amazon Web Services
        (AWS) DynamoDB database.
      </p>
      <h2>Data Distribution</h2>
      <p>
        No data is made public as it resides on a private database. The data
        stored is not and will not be disclosed to any third parties, with one
        possible exception. I will cooperate with government policies, and by
        doing so I will disclose information to a governmental organisation or
        law enforcement agency if the law deems necessary. Barring such an
        extenuating circumstance, the data stored, which are the weights all
        users (presumably) used for an exercise-related movement on any given
        day will be kept private and secure.
      </p>
      <h2>Future Alterations</h2>
      <p>
        No additional personal data is to be collected in the future. This
        document is, however, subject to minor changes. Although additional
        features are intended to be added (such as scheduled reminders) they
        will require the same level of permissions as before. That is to say,
        only the phone number of each user will be used. That being said I would
        now like to conclude by restating that as the user, your continual use
        of the skill will be assumed to be your unadulterated acceptance of this
        document.
      </p>
      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>
        If you have any questions regarding the privacy concerns, and / or
        practices employed in developing the skill, you may contact me at
        <a href="mailto:k.k.wadia@student.tudelft.nl" target="_blank">
          k.k.wadia@student.tudelft.nl
        </a>
        or
        <a href="mailto:kaizad@email.com" target="_blank"> kaizad@email.com </a
        >.
      </p>
      <h2>Addendum: Security</h2>
      <p>
        Several measures are taken so that the user's data is not mistakenly
        exposed. Firstly, the AWS account used to host the skill is private and
        only I have access to the resources in it. Secondly, the backend is
        configured with Skill Verification and is never invoked without the
        Alexa Skill ID being verified. Lastly, all the policies set within the
        account to the resources are done by giving the least privilege as
        possible to permit the skill to be full functional.
